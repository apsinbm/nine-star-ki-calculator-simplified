## Important Notes

### About February Birthdays ⚠️
If you were born **February 3-5**, your result depends on the exact time of Li Chun (立春, Start of Spring):
- **Before Li Chun**: You belong to the previous solar year
- **After Li Chun**: You belong to the current year

The calculator will show you a warning if this applies to you.

### Why Results May Differ
You might see different results on other websites because:
1. **Different calculation methods** (Japanese vs. Chinese)
2. **Different boundary date handling**
3. **Time zone differences**

This calculator uses the **Standard Japanese method**, which is most common in Western teaching.

A: The calculator auto-detects it, but you can change it if needed.

**Q: Is this scientifically accurate?**
